**SOME MODULA DEMO APPLICATIONS / USAGES**
Not sure if Modula is the right gallery plugin for you? We encourage you to take a look at other gallery plugins, but one thing you'll notice is that **they all look the same...**
**Sick and tired of boring galleries? Make your own and stand out with Modula.** 
Galleries created with Modula don't always look identical. With the Modula custom grid functionality, you can easily adjust the size and aspect ratio of each individual image by dragging from the bottom right-hand corner in the gallery edit area. 
Custom grids give you greater flexibility over how you display the images on your website. Easily control the size and look of your gallery - choosing the images you want to stand out, rather than relying on an algorithm.
Yes, that means you don't have to worry about your gallery awkwardly cropping out your subject or your subject not being at the center of the image.
Modula is the most powerful, customizable and easy-to-use WordPress gallery plugin available because we give you the power to choose everything from the height and width of your gallery down to resizing individual images within the container that makes sure your images never exceed the content area. 
**Ease-of-use shouldn't mean sample/basic Galleries**
Modula has been designed to be user-friendly from the ground up so that users of varying WordPress experience can easily create the perfect WordPress photo and image galleries. If you don't want all the customization features, you can leave everything up to the algorithm, and if you do - they're there so you can easily choose gallery size, margins between images, the color and size of captions. 
If you can't seem to figure something out, you can always check our [documentation](https://wp-modula.com/docs) or [get in touch](https://wp-modula.com/contact-us) - we're always happy to help...
